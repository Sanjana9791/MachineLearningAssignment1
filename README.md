NAME: SANJANA ARKATALA
STUDENT ID: 700687157

#Question1
• Sorted the array of ages using the sort() method.
• Used the append method to add the max and min age back to the list.
• Found the median, average and range of the ages.



#Question2
• Created a dog and student dictionary and added values to the given properties.
• Found the length of the student dictionary using 
• Printed the value of skills and the data type
• Modify the skills values by adding one or two skills using append()
• Got the dictionary keys and values as a list by using  list(Student.keys() and list(Student.values().



#Question3
• Created a tuple containing names of my sisters and brothers. Joined the brothers and sisters tuples and assigned it to siblings(siblings=sisters+brothers).
• Found the total number of siblings using len(siblings).
• Added mother’s and father’s name to the sibling tuple and assigned it as family_members tuple.


#Question4
Find the length of the set it_companies
• Added 'Twitter' to it_companies using it_companies.add('Twitter')
• Inserted multiple IT companies at once to the set using it_companies.update({'ADP','ValueLabs',"Accenture"})
• Removed one of the companies from the set it_companies using it_companies.remove('ValueLabs')
• Difference between discard() and remove() methods is:
discard() method removes the specified element and shows no error when the element is not there
Remove() method also works same as discard() but when element is not there in the set it raises an error.
•Used the set methods to Join A and B, Find A intersection B, Is A subset of B, Are A and B disjoint sets, Join A with B and B with A, 
•Found the symmetric difference between A and B using A.symmetric_difference(B).
• Deleted the sets completely using clear().
• Converted the ages to a set and compared the length of the list and the set using set(age), len(set(age) and len(age).

#Question5
Calculated the area and circumference of the circle and assigned the values to the variable names of _area_of_circle_ and _circumference_of_circle_. Took the user input of the radius and calculated the area of the circle.

#Question6
Used the split method len(set(sentence.split(' ')))) to display the unique words in the sentence.

#Question7
Used the tab escape sequence to display the given input.

#Question8
Generated the area of circle by using the string formatting method (The area of a circle with radius 10 is {0} meters square.'.format(int(area))).

#Question9
Created a weight list using for loop and converted the weights from  pounds to kilograms using kiloGrams.append(float(i/2.2086))
